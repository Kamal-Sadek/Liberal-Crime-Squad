## Catch2 is released!

If you've been using an earlier version of Catch, please see the 
Breaking Changes section of [the release notes](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/releases/tag/v2.0.1)
before moving to Catch2.

## What's the Catch?

Catch2 stands for C++ Automated Test Cases in a Header and is a
multi-paradigm test framework for C++. which also supports Objective-C
(and maybe C).
It is primarily distributed as a single header file, although certain
extensions may require additional headers.
