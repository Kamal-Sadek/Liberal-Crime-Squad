"Dogs are the future of humanity."
"I don't see it, but I'll hear you out."
#
"Power to the canines!"
"Down with the feline establishment!"
#
"We need to recruit more dogs."
"Oh yeah? I'm a dog. What do you represent?"
#
"Wanna join the LCS?"
"Do you have a good veteranary plan?"
#
"Want me to untie you?"
"Yes, please! This collar is painful!"
#
"You deserve better than this."
"Finally, a human that understands."
#
"Dogs are the best anything ever."
"Heheheh, you're funny. Okay, I won't rat you out."
#

"All we are saying is give fleas a chance."
"We'll fight the fleas until our dying itch."
#
"Dogs are better than humans."
"You're pandering, but I love it."
