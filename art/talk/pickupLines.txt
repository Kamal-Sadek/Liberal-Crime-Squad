# Lines beginning with the symbol '#' are ignored as comments
# blank lines are ignored, except if it is the second line of a pickup line
# or later.  That is, each line starts, then the next four lines are taken
# even if they are comments
# 
# The first two lines are the pickup,
# the third line is accepting, and the fourth and fifth lines are rejection
# 
#"Hey baby, you're kinda ugly. I like that.\"
#
#"You're not so cute yourself. Wanna get a room?\"
#"You're such an asshole!\"
# <pouts>
#
# The fifth line is placed between <> in all default pickup lines,
# and the fifth line is always colored white
# As a convention, a comment is placed between
# each pickup line to make it human readable
# but this is optional, i.e. placing fifteen lines
# in a row will be read as three separate pickup lines
# alternatively, blank lines can be placed between pickup lines
# as LCS will ignore blank lines between pickup lines
# but I recommend commenting, because crimesquad.exe
# will notify the user if any pickup line includes such a line
#
