#
cries out one last time
then is quiet.
#
murmurs quietly, breathing softly.
Then all is silent.
#
shouts "FATHER!  Why have you
forsaken me?" and dies in a heap.
#
cries silently for mother,
breathing slowly, then not at all.
#
breathes heavily, coughing up
blood...  then is quiet.
#
silently drifts away, and
is gone.
#
whines loudly, voice crackling,
then curls into a ball, unmoving.
#
shivers silently, whispering
a prayer, then all is still.
