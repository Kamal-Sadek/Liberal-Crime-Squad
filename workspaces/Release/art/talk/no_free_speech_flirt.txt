# Lines beginning with the symbol '#' are ignored as comments
# blank lines are ignored, except if it is the second line of a pickup line
# or later.  That is, each line starts, then the next four lines are taken
# even if they are comments
# 
# The first two lines are the pickup,
# the third line is accepting, and the fourth and fifth lines are rejection
# 
# all 3 of the rejection lines are from Darth Vader
# (the 3rd one from back when he's a little kid)
# These are the "no free speech" pickup lines
