When  writing news  stories,  &c centers the text,  and &r denotes  the end of a
paragraph.  Please also try to avoid using tabs, and instead use mere spaces, as
this  usually causes  nightmares  in  formatting  for others.  Instead  of using
rand(void) or random(void), please use LCSrandom(int max) instead. Additionally,
std::cout  is  not used,  instead,  addstr()  is.  Miscellaneous  functions  are
traditionally  lumped into  commonactions.cpp. I personally  try to  avoid this,
instead placing  functions related to the game internally,  as opposed to string
manipulation, etc.  (i.e. maxskill(int skill, Creature& cr, bool use_juice=true)
goes      in      commonactions.cpp,     and     makestate(char    *str)     and
romannumeral(int amendnum) go in misc.cpp.)
