Windows easy mode compilation
-----------------------------
Easiest way is using the workspaces provided in the 'workspaces' folder. Project files are provided for:

 * VisualStudio 
 * Code::Blocks

 
 Files to include in Windows distributions of Liberal Crime Squad
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
 * The LCS executable: on Windows this is "crimesquad.exe" in either
   "workspaces\Debug" for a debug build or "workspaces\Release" for a release
   build.  Of course you should compile a new executable from the latest code.
 * The curses library: on Windows this is "pdcurses.dll" in the "workspaces" directory.
 * The "art" directory and all the files in it.
 * The "init.txt" configuration file.
 * The "CrimeSquadManual.txt" documentation file from the "docs" directory.
