If you can think of improvements to these lyrics that still fit the rhythm of the U.S.
national anthem you are welcome to contribute as long as you also keep your contributions
public domain, that makes things easier.

The purpose of this is to make a recording of the national anthem to these lyrics
(with good sound recording equipment and someone who has a nice voice), to use as
the victory song for the game. The original recording should be encoded as a lossless
FLAC, with 44100 Hz sample rate, while the version we bundle with the game itself
will be a low-bitrate Ogg Vorbis file (for people who download the Ogg Vorbis music
to use with the game). It is intended as a replacement for the current victory.ogg
(which is also the national anthem, but without LCS lyrics).


Oh say have you heard how our country was saved
By the Liberal Crime Squad's heroic endeavors?
They faced dangers galore, but prevailed in the end
When the people woke up, and united behind them.
Their Conservative foes, who had misruled this land,
Gave up in the end when they saw they were wrong.
Oh say does that star-spangled banner burn brightly
Here in the land of the free and the home of the brave?

The people of this land were once badly misled
And for quite a long time Liberals faced misfortune.
Racist, sexist bigots oppressed minorities
As a huge military killed innocent people.
Pollution fouled nature, animals were abused,
And the people could not openly air their views.
But then the Liberal Crime Squad came along and saved the day
Here in the land of the free and the home of the brave.

Now our country's at peace, and our workers have rights,
And the moneyed interests no longer rule our nation.
Our elections are fair, and our laws are more just,
As we work together for a more perfect union.
But this cause is unfinished, there's more work to be done,
Though we know, in our hearts, that we've already won.
As our nation works together to solve its remaining problems,
Here in the land of the free and the home of the brave.
