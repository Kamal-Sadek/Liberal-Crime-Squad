Here are some notes on adding music to the game, such as where to find free music,
and how to solve a certain problem (the problem of incompatible sample rates that
SDL2_mixer can't handle)... basically convert the files into a sample rate that
SDL2_mixer CAN handle. So if you are a programmer on the main project wanting to
add more music or replace some music, or a modder looking to add your own music for
a mod, you should read this next bit of documentation.

Another note about music: for Ogg Vorbis files to work with SDL2_mixer, they can’t be 48 kHz,
that sampling rate is not supported. They should all have a 44.1 kHz sampling rate. And all
the ones I included had a target bitrate of about 64 kbps but actually turned out to be on
average maybe 54 kbps instead, about 10 kbps lower, saving disk space, which is good.
Anyway, 48 kHz or higher isn’t allowed with SDL2_mixer, use 44.1 kHz files. If you use a
48 kHz Ogg Vorbis file you will hear the most awful sound from your computer speakers when
the game tries to play the file. The 48 kHz files tend to be from the Musopen project, most
other websites use 44.1 kHz, but you can’t be sure until after you download it.

In Audacity (the free software music editing and converting program), you can change the
sample rate of a 48 kHz file to 44.1 kHz but then after you do that be sure to go to the
Effect menu and choose Change Speed and then increase the speed by exactly 8.125%. This
corrects for the change in sample rate so that the music will still play back at the same
speed and have the same pitch and tempo as before. If you don’t do this it plays back at
a tempo that’s 8.125% slower, and the frequency of every musical note is 8.125% lower,
and we don’t want that, it needs to be corrected to sound just like the original. Why
8.125%? Because 44.1 is exactly 8.125% lower than 48, obviously. Also, you need to change
both the sample rate of the tracks (on the left side of the screen sorta near the top) as
well as the sample rate of the project (in the lower left corner) from 48 kHz to 44.1 kHz
(or from 48000 Hz to 44100 Hz if you are using Hz instead of kHz as a unit). As for if you
are using a different program than Audacity for this... whatever, Audacity is free software
and cross-platform and has the best features, so you should use it, and if you’re using
something else, figure it out yourself.

Why is all of this necessary? Because SDL2_mixer doesn’t have sophisticated sample rate
conversion implemented, that’s why. So your sound files and SDL2_mixer should use the
same sample rate, and 44.1 kHz is a value that works cross-platform on pretty much any
audio driver and 44.1 kHz audio files are way more common than 48 kHz audio files anyway.
If you set up SDL2_mixer to use the 48 kHz sample rate, then it WOULD be able to playback
48 kHz audio files but it wouldn’t be able to playback 44.1 kHz audio files anymore. Its
sample rate conversion is probably good enough to deal with multiples of 2, so if you have
a 44.1 kHz sample rate for SDL2_mixer, you’ll probably be able to play 22050 Hz sound
files and 11025 Hz sound files, but I’m not sure. Point is, 48 kHz and SDL2_mixer don't
go together, they are like oil and water... like oil that’s on fire and water... you
can’t use water to put out an oil fire, in fact it spreads the flames. That’s just a
metaphor for why 48 kHz is a bad idea to use with SDL2_mixer and why you need to use
something like Audacity to convert any 48 kHz files to 44.1 kHz so they’ll work with
SDL2_mixer. Also 48 kHz might not work on all platforms, we want the game to stay
cross-platform (some platforms don't support sample rates above 44.1 kHz in their
sound drivers).
