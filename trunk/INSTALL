Install instructions for Liberal Crime Squad

Installation notes for Unix-based systems:

The executable is called crimesquad, and will be placed in <prefix>/bin by 
default.

The art will be placed in <prefix>/share/lcs/art by default. The game
can scan some likely locations for the art, but whatever datadir you
choose will be hard-coded into the game so it can find the art easily.
if you change the datadir or prefix, make sure you run 'make clean'
and 'make' again before attempting to install.

The manual will be placed in <prefix>/man/<man_sub_dir> by default.
man_sub_dir is normally man6 for games.

When you compile the game for yourself, configure sets the default prefix
to /usr/local. For packages, the prefix is usually /usr.


Basic installation from source:

First run:
	./configure
To install to a different directory than '/usr/local' run:
	./configure --prefix=/path/to/install/to
You may configure the program to install different parts in different places.
Run ./configure with the --help option to see these different options.

Configure will now scan your system to make sure you have the necessary
libraries and applications to be able to compile and install the game.
If you do not, configure will tell you; you should then download and 
install the necessary programs and libraries and then try to configure again.

After configure is completed, you may type 'make' to begin the conpilation.
Running make with the -j# flag (where # is a number) will run # make
processes. This may speed up your compilation.

After make is complete, type 'make install' to install the program.


Installation on Windows:

No install is necessary. Just unzip and play.
