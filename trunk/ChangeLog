page.

2007-07-10   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* includes.h, commondisplay.cpp: Added function called printfunds(3) which 
prints funds at the specified location, prefixes some text, and then returns
everything (such as color and cursor location) back to the way it was before.
* activate.cpp, reviewmode.cpp, baseactions.cpp, commondisplay.cpp, date.cpp:
Changes all money displaying to use new function.
* newgame.cpp: Added ability to use real name by default for character

ChangeLog for Version 3.11.3:

2007-07-08   Jonathan Stickles   <jonathansfox@users.sourceforge.net>
* includes.h, configure.ac: Updated to version 3.11.3 for release.

2007-07-08   Jonathan Stickles   <jonathansfox@users.sourceforge.net>
* daily.cpp: Fixed a bug causing vacation dates to never end.

2007-06-30   Jonathan Stickles   <jonathansfox@users.sourceforge.net>
* lcsio.cpp, lcsio.h: Windows version of the new I/O uses _mkdir and includes
direct.h for VC++ support.
* fight.cpp: Liberals that are captured now lose their hostages.
* daily.cpp: Liberals that lose contact and go into hiding now stop their
current actions.
* daily.cpp: Dates can now only be gone on if the Liberal is either in the
hospital or at a safehouse.
* news.cpp: The news no longer specifies whether you were killed when the LCS
squad is wiped out on site, in order to support cases where you were really just
arrested.
* siege.cpp: Hostages which are rescued can no longer continue to be tended.
* justice.cpp: During trials and on release from prison, Liberals are now
transferred to the homeless shelter as their new base if their current base is
no longer a safehouse.

2007-06-30   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* lcsio.h, lcsio.cpp: Completely rewrote the LCS I/O system. Use LCSOpenFile
and LCSCloseFile now, see documentation in lcsio.h for help.
* cursesmovie.h, cursesmovie.cpp, news.cpp, highscore.cpp, saveload.cpp:
Changed saving and loading to use C I/O with file handle returned by the new
IO functions. This system should be portable, further testing on Linux will
be necessary.

2007-06-23   Jonathan Stickles   <jonathansfox@users.sourceforge.net>
* fight.cpp: You will now only be charged with assault for attacking people who
aren't already hostile to you.

2007-06-23   Jonathan Stickles   <jonathansfox@users.sourceforge.net>
* justice.cpp: Fixed a bug which would give you a warning 1 in 4 times if you
didn't commit murder instead of your proper sentence.

ChangeLog for Version 3.11.2:

2007-06-17   Jonathan Stickles & Chris Johnson
* baseactions.cpp: Fixed Linux flag burning bug.

2007-06-17   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* lcsio.cpp: Changed mode for read only to actually be read only.
Changed order of art search paths.

2007-06-18   Jonathan Stickles   <jonathansfox@users.sourceforge.net>
* fight.cpp: Fixed a sneaky bug in which having high health doesn't protect you
from damage, it protects your opponent from recieving damage from you. Fighter
archetype characters and people with high health stats are now much more
powerful, because they were actually being weakened by their own health rather
than strengthened by it.

2007-06-18   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* src/Makefile.am, f[l]ight.cpp: Renamed flight.cpp to fight.cpp, which it was
supposed to be called. Modified Makefile.am to reflect this change.
* Makefile.am, workspaces/game.cbp: Added workspace for Code::Blocks.

2007-06-19   Jonathan Stickles   <jonathansfox@users.sourceforge.net>
* news.cpp, newstops.cpc: Added art for the Liberal Guardian to be
turned into a major newspaper later.

2007-06-19   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* configure.ac, includes.h: Changed version to "3.11.1svn2"
as Jonathan's changes with the art may break compatability with older
versions.

2007-06-19   Jonathan Stickles   <jonathansfox@users.sourceforge.net>
* chase.cpp: Fixed a crash bug relating to squad members not being
removed from their squad if killed in a car chase away from their
squad.

2007-06-20   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* getnames.cpp (enter_name): Added a function to allow a player to enter 
a name. Supports a default value and length.
* includes.h: Added a function prototype for enter_name.
* includes.h: Added a #define called CREATURE_NAMELEN and set it to
the maximum name length. Used this value in declaration of creaturest.
* date.cpp (completedate, completevacation): Used enter_name for name entry.
* haulkidnap.cpp (kidnaptransfer): Used enter_name for name entry.

2007-06-20   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* includes.h: Added SLOGAN_LEN which is set to the length of the slogan.
Changed the declarations of slogan to SLOGAN_LEN+1, and the declaration of 
name and propername in creaturest to CREATURE_NAMELEN+1. The last character
is for a NULL that will not be overwritten by mvgetnstr().
* basemode/reviewmode.cpp: Changed mvgetstr to mvgetnstr to prevent overflows
of the creature's name.
* basemode/baseactions.cpp: Changed mvgetstr to mvgetnstr to prevent overflows
of the slogan.

2007-06-20   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* reviewmode.cpp (review_mode): Terminated string to prevent overflow.
* baseactions.cpp (getslogan): Terminated string to prevent overflow.
* newgame.cpp (makecharacter): Changed mvgetstr to mvgetnstr and terminated
string to prevent overflow.
* commondisplay.cpp (fullstatus): Changed mvgetstr to mvgetnstr and terminated
string to prevent overflow.
* getnames.cpp (enter_name): Terminated string to prevent overflow.
* includes.h: Took away the +1's as they are no longer needed.

2007-06-21   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* reviewmode.cpp, baseactions.cpp, newgame.cpp, commondisplay.cpp: 
mvgetnstr does not work with my PDcurses, and I am assuming that other people
will have trouble as well. I changed everything from my previous change to use
enter_name for string entry.
* includes.h: Changed SLOGAN_LEN to 79. I think that the code that centers 
the slogan on the screen can not handle a slogan that is 80 chars long, as 
that is the size of the screen. No crashes for the slogan now.

2007-06-21   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* game.cpp, includes.h: Created function called end_game which will clean up
memory and close the game to prevent memory leaks.
* lcsio.cpp: Fixed lcs_home memory leak by freeing and reallocating it each 
time it is needed.
* titlescreen.cpp, commonactions.cpp, endgame.cpp, monthly.cpp: Modified
some of the exit code to use new end_game function.

2007-06-21   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* game.cpp, includes.h: Redefined all slogan vars to have length SLOGAN_LEN+1.
The save/load system does not like 79 byte slogans. The other code
that sets slogan still uses SLOGAN_LEN, so only 79 bytes will be shown.

2007-06-22   Jonathan Stickles   <jonathansfox@users.sourceforge.net>
* extern.h, game.cpp, includes.h, activate.cpp, baseactions.cpp, basemode.cpp,
commondisplay.cpp, activities.cpp, siege.cpp, monthly.cpp, saveload.cpp:
Continuation of the ongoing massive overhaul of the Liberal Guardian design.
This may be the final design for the system for now.
* commonactions.cpp, activities.cpp, lcsmonthly.cpp, miscactions.cpp:
change_public_opinion no longer has a default cap of 10 points of public opinion
shift per call. Formerly this cap was changable through an optional fourth
parameter. Now the fourth parameter is the maximum to increase public opinion
to, and defaults to 100. Calls throughout the code changed appropriately.
* news.cpp: Changed the way the public opinion changes from news stories and
site actions is calculated.
* commonactions.cpp, siege.cpp: Changed the way law enforcement "heat" is
calculated.
* justice.cpp: Changed the way the strength of legal prosecution is calculated.
* monthly.cpp: Changed the way public opinion drifts are calculated.
* news.cpp: Unlawful entry no longer generates a news story.
* game.cpp, includes.h: Moved debug defines from game.cpp to includes.h.
* includes.h: Advanced version to 3.11.1svn3. Old saves are now obsolete.

2007-06-22   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* includes.h: Changed version of lowest save to 3.11.2.

2007-06-22   Jonathan Stickles   <jonathansfox@users.sourceforge.net>
* chase.cpp: The cops now play mercifully nice. You can always pull over or give
up in a police chace, even if you start shooting earlier in the fight. You still
can't surrender to death squads or non-police enemies.
* chase.cpp: Changed the driveskill calculation. Driving skill is now more
important. The speed of your car is also more important. Having an injured
driver is now very bad. Shooting the enemy driver is now very good.
* justice.cpp: Tweaked the way scarefactor works in court again.

2007-06-23   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* lcsio.cpp: Added ../art to the art search path. Forced Windows to search
../art as well.

2007-06-23   Jonathan Stickles   <jonathansfox@users.sourceforge.net>
* justice.cpp: You can now be charged with multiple counts of the same crime.

2007-06-23   Chris Johnson & Jonathan Stickles
* chase.cpp: Fixed bug #1741974, Hostages not freed if arrested during
car chase.
* haulkidnap.cpp: Added new situation to freehostage to not print anything.
