ChangeLog for Version 3.11.1svn:

2007-06-17   Jonathan Stickles & Chris Johnson
* baseactions.cpp: Fixed Linux flag burning bug.

2007-06-17   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* lcsio.cpp: Changed mode for read only to actually be read only.
Changed order of art search paths.

2007-06-18   Jonathan Stickles   <jonathansfox@users.sourceforge.net>
* fight.cpp: Fixed a sneaky bug in which having high health doesn't protect you
from damage, it protects your opponent from recieving damage from you. Fighter
archetype characters and people with high health stats are now much more
powerful, because they were actually being weakened by their own health rather
than strengthened by it.

2007-06-18   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* src/Makefile.am, f[l]ight.cpp: Renamed flight.cpp to fight.cpp, which it was
supposed to be called. Modified Makefile.am to reflect this change.
* Makefile.am, workspaces/game.cbp: Added workspace for Code::Blocks.

2007-06-19   Jonathan Stickles   <jonathansfox@users.sourceforge.net>
* news.cpp, newstops.cpc: Added art for the Liberal Guardian to be
turned into a major newspaper later.

2007-06-19   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* configure.ac, includes.h: Changed version to "3.11.1svn2"
as Jonathan's changes with the art may break compatability with older
versions.

2007-06-19   Jonathan Stickles   <jonathansfox@users.sourceforge.net>
* chase.cpp: Fixed a crash bug relating to squad members not being
removed from their squad if killed in a car chase away from their
squad.

2007-06-20   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* getnames.cpp (enter_name): Added a function to allow a player to enter 
a name. Supports a default value and length.
* includes.h: Added a function prototype for enter_name.
* includes.h: Added a #define called CREATURE_NAMELEN and set it to
the maximum name length. Used this value in declaration of creaturest.
* date.cpp (completedate, completevacation): Used enter_name for name entry.
* haulkidnap.cpp (kidnaptransfer): Used enter_name for name entry.

2007-06-20   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* includes.h: Added SLOGAN_LEN which is set to the length of the slogan.
Changed the declarations of slogan to SLOGAN_LEN+1, and the declaration of 
name and propername in creaturest to CREATURE_NAMELEN+1. The last character
is for a NULL that will not be overwritten by mvgetnstr().
* basemode/reviewmode.cpp: Changed mvgetstr to mvgetnstr to prevent overflows
of the creature's name.
* basemode/baseactions.cpp: Changed mvgetstr to mvgetnstr to prevent overflows
of the slogan.

2007-06-20   Chris Johnson   <grundee@users.sourceforge.net>
* reviewmode.cpp (review_mode): Terminated string to prevent overflow.
* baseactions.cpp (getslogan): Terminated string to prevent overflow.
* newgame.cpp (makecharacter): Changed mvgetstr to mvgetnstr and terminated
string to prevent overflow.
* commondisplay.cpp (fullstatus): Changed mvgetstr to mvgetnstr and terminated
string to prevent overflow.
* getnames.cpp (enter_name): Terminated string to prevent overflow.
* includes.h: Took away the +1's as they are no longer needed.
