Liberal Crime Squad
===================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bregma/Liberal-Crime-Squad.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bregma/Liberal-Crime-Squad)

On Febuary 4, 1974, the Symbionese Liberation Army, an American self-styled
urban gurrilla warfare group kidnapped 19-year-old media heiress Patricia Hearst
as she and her 26-year-old boyfriend, Steven Weed, sat relaxing in their
Berkeley, California home....

Liberal Crime Squad is a satirical ASCII-style political role-playing/strategy
game in which you recruit a team of Elite Liberal radicals and try to save the
United States from a descent into Arch-Conservatism.  Gameplay is based loosely
on the classic 1983 RPG Oubliette.

This Fork
---------

LCS was originally developed by Tarn Adams at Bay 12 Games (2002-2004).  It was
then taken over by community developers lead by Jonathan Stickles and Chris Johnson
hosted at SourceForge (2007-2014).  This fork is derived from Kamal Sadek's augmentation
fork ar GitHub.  It's purely a sandbox version, but since it's licensed under
the GPLv2+, I can make any modifications I want as along as I make the source
available, and if anyone is uncomfortable with that let me know and I'll change
the name of the project.

Building From Source
--------------------

I'm a fan of automated integration, and to that end I have set up an automated
integration build from the GitHub repo through the Travis-CI service.  I'm
targeting Win32, Win64, and Linux binaries, and everything is built or
cross-built on a Linux host.  I've removed most of the support for building
though an arbitrary IDE:  if you want to clone the code and build, you're going
to need a POSIX shell and tools or a GUI that can cope with an autotool build
directly.  It's my sandbox, I get to be tinpot about it.

*If it's too serious for you, just skip it -- we don't take the game seriously,
either, so no worries.*

**Go Forth, and Pursue your Liberal Agenda!**
