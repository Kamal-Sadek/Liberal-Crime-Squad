## Liberal Crime Squad

Welcome to Liberal Crime Squad! The Conservatives have taken the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches of government. Over time, the Liberal laws of this nation will erode and turn the country into a BACKWOODS YET CORPORATE NIGHTMARE. To prevent this from happening, the Liberal Crime Squad was established. The mood of the country is shifting, and we need to turn things around. Go out on the streets and indoctrinate Conservative automatons. That is, let them see their True Liberal Nature. Then arm them and send them forth to Stop Evil.

This version of Liberal Crime Squad is an unofficial transfer from SourceForge. A full list of authors is available in AUTHORS.

To tap into this newfound science, Activate a Liberal who has a science skill of 1 or greater, go into the 'D - Recruitment' menu, and '5 - Augment' task. From here, you can select a Brave Liberal Pioneer to test this new technology and advance the Liberal Cause.
