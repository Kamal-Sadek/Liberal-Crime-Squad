 * A skill has an ID (currently from a hard-coded enumeration called CreatureSkill),
 * a name (magically associated with the hard-coded enumeration through the
 * static member function get_name()) and the ID of an associated character
 * attribute (mostly hard-coded through the static member function get_associated_attribute()).
 *
 * Use of the @p skill and @p associated_value members is unclear.
 *
 * Ultimately, this should morph into a loadable SkillType, which can be stashed
 * in a SkillTypeCache as stored in Pandora's box, and each creature should have
 * a SkillSet (of arbitrary size) associating a SkillType and a numeric value.
